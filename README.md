# AI4EDU_Study_Planner

This project was made by Emily Huixin WU, Henrik KLASEN and Albane KERAUDREN-RIGUIDEL for the course AI4EDUCATION at the University of Luxembourg.

The plan is to develop a study planning assistant who will accompany the students during their studies and give them personnalized tips and exercises. In addition, a study plan for exams will be created based on previous performances in Multiple Choice Quizzes.
